**Version:** 0.1 (Draft)

## 1. Overview

The Restaurant Reservation Chatbot Widget is a conversational web widget designed for restaurants to handle table bookings directly on their websites. It uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to enable natural language interactions (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like a table for 2 at 7pm tomorrow‚Äù) and logs structured reservation data into Google Sheets for restaurant staff.

## 2. Goals & Objectives

- Automate reservations: Reduce manual phone/email bookings.
- Improve UX: Allow customers to book tables naturally, not through rigid forms.
- Centralize data: Store reservations in Google Sheets (lightweight, easy for staff).
- Scalability: Create a reusable widget template that could be extended to other small businesses.

## 7. User Stories

**Customer**
- As a diner, I want to type ‚ÄúI need a table for 2 tomorrow at 7pm‚Äù so that the bot books me without multiple form fields.
- As a diner, I want to confirm my booking details before submission so I feel confident the restaurant received it.

**Restaurant Staff**
- As a restaurant owner, I want all reservations logged in Google Sheets so I can see them easily.
- As a restaurant owner, I want the chatbot to always confirm booking details so I don‚Äôt get incomplete reservations.

- Secondary: Reduction in phone/email bookings.
